      "Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when ﬁne-tuned on down- stream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl- edge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre- trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem- ory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com- pare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge- intensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we ﬁnd that RAG models generate more speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.\n",

      "Pre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl- edge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down- sides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted. REALM [20] and ORQA [31], two recently introduced models that combine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,\n",
